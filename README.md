# Project 1 : FoodHub Data Analysis

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to draw some actionable insights for the business. As a Data Scientist in this company I am required to work on some of the key questions that need to be answered. I performed the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.
